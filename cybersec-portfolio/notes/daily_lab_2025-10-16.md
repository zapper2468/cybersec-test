# Daily Lab Notes â€“ 2025-10-16

## Today's Focus
- Read about TLS/HTTPS and certificate validation
- Practiced generating secure passwords and storing secrets safely
- Reviewed basics of logging and monitoring failed authentications

## Key Learnings
- TLS provides encryption in transit; always validate certificates in clients
- Use `secrets` module in Python for cryptographically secure random values
- Centralized logging helps detect brute-force and anomalous activity

## Next Steps
- Integrate secure password generator into a small utility
- Practice setting up a local logging/monitoring stack (e.g., filebeat + ELK)
- Start a short CTF challenge on a web vuln focused room
