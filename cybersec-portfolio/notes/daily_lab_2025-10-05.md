# Daily Lab Notes â€“ 2025-10-05

## Today's Focus
- Learned about password hashing and brute force protection
- Explored OWASP Top 10 web vulnerabilities
- Practiced using Hashcat for password cracking (offline lab)

## Key Learnings
- Always store passwords using salted hashes (e.g., bcrypt, PBKDF2)
- OWASP provides a great list of real-world vulnerabilities
- Brute forcing is time-consuming without optimization and GPU acceleration

## Next Steps
- Build a simple password strength checker in Python
- Review OWASP Top 10 examples in a safe test environment
