# Daily Lab Notes – 2025-10-07

## Today's Focus
- Learned about port scanning and banner grabbing
- Practiced using Nmap scripts (NSE)
- Explored Python socket programming for network scanning

## Key Learnings
- Nmap’s `-sC` flag runs default scripts for deeper detection
- Banner grabbing reveals useful info (like software versions)
- Python’s `socket` library can automate basic scanning

## Next Steps
- Create a small script to scan open ports and detect banners
- Try automating scans on a local VM network
